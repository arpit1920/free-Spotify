Making Spotify Ads free with an amount of $0
If you are having a problem with ads crashing your Spotify program, consider closing some unneeded programs that are left open on your computer. This may allow your PC to prioritize the Spotify program and give it the resources it needs
Three weeks ago I downloaded the app of Spotify for my android phone All was good, up to when the ads come in: the music stops and the ads don't start until I touch on the Play button. Since this happens every 30 minutes or less, it's quite tedious to click on the app every time.
What can I do? 
I resolve the problem today by Python and yes, It is worth working, I got Spotify ad-free with an investment of $0.
